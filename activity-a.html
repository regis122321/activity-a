	<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
	<!-- Preamble paragraph -->
	<p>
		The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction. The clauses that are included in the full version give emaple and detail of how these aspirations change the way we act as a software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the detail can become legalistic and tedious; without the detail, the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the detail form a cohesive code.
